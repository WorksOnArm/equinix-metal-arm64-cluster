# Works on Arm Equinix Cluster

Arm and Equinix have partnered to make powerful Neoverse based Armv8 bare metal infrastructure
including latest generation Ampere and Marvell systems â€” available for open source software
developers to build, test and optimize for Arm64 architecture.

The [Works on Arm program](https://www.arm.com/markets/computing-infrastructure/works-on-arm)
provides free access to state-of-the-art computing resources for open source developers.
The on-demand infrastructure resource is managed by [Equinix](https://metal.equinix.com/)
as part of its commitment to the Arm communities.
Funding for the system is provided by Arm Inc.

Apply to use the on-demand infrastructure by [creating an issue](https://github.com/WorksOnArm/equinix-metal-arm64-cluster/issues/new/choose) in this repository.

Add comments to existing issue for any change in authorized users (add/remove/edit) or change in infrastructure requirements (machine type/number).
