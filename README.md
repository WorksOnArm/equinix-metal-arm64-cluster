# Works on Arm Equinix Metal Cluster

Arm and Equinix Metal have partnered to make powerful Neoverse based Armv8 bare metal infrastructure
including latest generation Ampere and Marvell systems â€” available for open source software
developers to build, test and optimize for Arm64 architecture.

The [Works on Arm program](https://www.worksonarm.com)
provides free access to state-of-the-art computing resources for open source developers.
The on-demand infrastructure resource is managed by [Equinix Metal](https://metal.equinix.com/)
as part of its commitment to the Arm communities.
Funding for the system is provided by Arm Inc.
